# DashLight
The DashLight is one of the HMI design component of ATeam (https://wordpress.com/view/chaoswang.wordpress.com) (https://ateam-eindhoven.nl), to enhancing situational awareness of people sittiing in the autonomous driving vehicle. 

DashLight uses LED on the dashboard as ambient display to delivery peripheral information,as a supplement of centre screen. The panel on the dash board consists of multiple perspex-spots, lighten by one led strip that can change colours and patterns of lights.

The structure design of LED panel has three benefits: 
1.Defusing the light, without distracting drivers. 
2.Makeing sure that light shines to the driver, avoiding reflection on the windshield. 
3.Gorgeous, intergrated into the interior of the vehicle.

Through modular design, DashLight fits in different kinds of dashboard, roof, side door. This project enable each researcher to implement his/her ambient lighting prototype in feild study.
